## Soketi Reborn - Upgraded to uWebSocket 20.43 and several Imrpovements.

As we all know that original Soketi project was not getting much of attention, i have been using Soketi heavily throughout my projects & i wanted to contribute to the community so that they can also utilize the latest improvements in Soketi. As of now i have upgraded the core of Soketi from uWebSocket 20.10 to 20.43 which is the last release upto today (14/03/2024).

I have added Subscription Count for all channel types and now WebHook will tell you about a channels subscribed user counts. 

Node is now upgraded to latest and in future releases we will stop using PM2 (actually in my builds i dont even now, but some user prefer it so its present.)

More changes will be coming soon. 

## Soketi can be now deployed on Cloudflare's infrastructure. üì£ 

Ever dreamed about Serverless WebSockets? Soketi can be deployed to Cloudflare Workers. All around the world, closer to your users. Same Pusher protocol. 
Powered by Cloudflare's [Durable Objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/durable-objects/) and [KV](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/kv/), you can achieve great speeds at edge for your users.

Deploy fast Workers, use one of the fastest database available from Cloudflare and scale to infinity and beyond. üöÄ

soketi is your simple, fast, and resilient open-source WebSockets server. üì£

### Blazing fast speed ‚ö°

The server is built on top of [uWebSockets.js](https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets.js) - a C application ported to Node.js. uWebSockets.js is demonstrated to perform at levels [_8.5x that of Fastify_](https://alexhultman.medium.com/serving-100k-requests-second-from-a-fanless-raspberry-pi-4-over-ethernet-fdd2c2e05a1e) and at least [_10x that of Socket.IO_](https://medium.com/swlh/100k-secure-websockets-with-raspberry-pi-4-1ba5d2127a23). ([_source_](https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets.js))

### Cheaper than most competitors ü§ë

Compared with Pusher, you can achieve much more for less than one-third of the price.

For a $49 plan on Pusher, you get a limited amount of connections (500) and messages (30M).

With Soketi, for the price of an instance on Vultr or DigitalOcean ($5-$10), you get virtually unlimited connections, messages, and some more!

Soketi is capable to hold thousands of active connections with high traffic on less than **1 GB and 1 CPU** in the cloud. You can also [get free $100 on Vultr to try out soketi ‚Üí](https://www.vultr.com/?ref=9032189-8H)

### Easy to use üë∂

Whether you run your infrastructure in containers or monoliths, soketi got your back. There are multiple ways to [install](https://docs.soketi.app/getting-started/installation) and [configure](https://docs.soketi.app/getting-started/environment-variables) soketi, from single instances for development, to tens of active instances at scale with hundreds or thousands of active users.

### Pusher Protocol v7 üì°

soketi implements the [Pusher Protocol v7](https://pusher.com/docs/channels/library\_auth\_reference/pusher-websockets-protocol#version-7-2017-11). Therefore, any Pusher-maintained or compatible client can connect to it, bringing a plug-and-play experience for existing applications that are already compatible with this protocol.

### App-based access üîê

You and your users can access the API and WebSockets through [Pusher-like apps](https://docs.soketi.app/app-management/introduction) which serve keys and secrets to connect or authenticate requests for broadcasting events or checking channels statuses. soketi also comes built-in with support for DynamoDB and SQL-based servers like Postgres.

### Production-ready! ü§ñ

In addition to being a good companion during local development, soketi comes with the resiliency and speed required for demanding production applications.

### Built-in monitoring üìà

soketi just exposes the metrics to you, you just have to scrape them, whether it's a simple HTTP Client to pull the current usage, or you're using Prometheus to monitor all the connections.

## ü§ù Supporting

**soketi is meant to be free, forever. Having a good companion for developing real-time applications locally and in production should not involve any third-party and having a reliable websocket server to deploy behind a firewall makes soketi a compelling option for many applications.**

**Of course, like many open source software solutions, development is done by investing volunteer time into the project. Therefore, all donations are greatly appreciated. You can sponsor the development via **[**Github Sponsors**](https://github.com/sponsors/rennokki)**.**
